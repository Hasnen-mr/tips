  "tip_data":["It Can Kill Your Confidence - There is nothing sexier than a confident man (or woman). Your weight can kill your confidence if it’s not where you want it to be. Great sex requires confidence in yourself and what you’re doing. You can't be confident if the only thought on your mind is a negative view of yourself. The lack of confidence can make you feel like less of a man.","It Can Drain Your Energy - What you eat and how active you are (through exercise) affects your energy levels. Everyone who reads this will have a different kind of sex life, but all of them require energy -- especially for those longer sessions. If you are overweight or out of shape, you won’t last as long or enjoy it as much because the energy won’t be there","It Can Affect The Experience - If you are somewhere else in your mind and lacking confidence, the quality of your sexual experience will be diminished. Quality sex isn’t necessarily about the length or number of positions; it’s about how involved you are with each other and whether or not you can find those pleasures points. Your weight can kill the quality and force great sex to be replaced with quickies.","It Can Hurt Your Thoughts - If you are worried about what your partner is thinking, or your thoughts are caught up in your weight, you can’t let go. Your thoughts should be focused on who you’re with and the pleasure of the experience can bring. Your weight can cloud the healthy thoughts that allow you to fully enjoy sex","It Can Make Your Sex Life HOT - If you are making healthy food choices and exercise regularly, you are in a good position. You can come into the bedroom and use that energy to give into your animal urges. Let go and be there in that moment of pleasure. Enter the bedroom with confidence and leave exhausted. ","Treating someone’s body like it is literally the best thing you have ever seen EVER - Absolute adoration of your body is DEFINITELY one","Knowing the importance of consent - Work it into your foreplay. Say ‘I’m going to do _____ to _____. Would you like that? Can I do that to you?’ If they’re unsure, uncomfortable, or flat-out say that they’re not into it, then BACK OFF. Do not push it. Reassure your partner that it’s OK to say ‘I’m not really into this right now.’ Don’t make them feel bad for denying. When you’re changing from one action to another, ask if it’s OK. Once again, you can make this sexy without killing the mood, if you so please. Someone who is good in bed is someone who pays attention to their partner. Ask for consent and see what they are into first.","Talking about sex and what each person likes/dislikes like it’s NBD","Someone who’s willing talk to you about what they want and what you want and then deliver.","Getting a little weird - “It’s all about experimentation. Finding out what your partner enjoys and what they don’t. It’s OK to come right out and ask; it’s also OK to figure out along the way. But don’t hold back — don’t be afraid to show off those quirky sex things you’ve always wanted to try. A partner that you work well with will understand and probably show you a thing or two you didn’t think you could like","Being honest about orgasms","Stop faking orgasms! When you are sending out the ‘Way to go, Casanova’ vibes, they aren’t going to know they are in your belly button. Moving your hips or guiding them with your hand or moans will turn them into great lovers and they will think they did it on their own. You both win","Sharing a particular kink - Similar tastes. Among all the others (consent, communication, etc.) that are pretty obvious, there’s nothing better than finding out that your partner has a kink that is perfectly in line with your own","Being a giver - Acting like all that matters is my pleasure and how I feel. That makes me sound selfish, but it makes me want to do to the same to the other party and makes me want to try to match their efforts. It can make for a very intense sexual experience","But also being a little selfish - You need to get the balance between being a totally selfless lover, one who is rewarded by seeing your lover’s pleasure, and being just selfish enough to be able to intensely enjoy the sex","Laughing when it’s acceptable to laugh - Giggling and being playful is a must. Taking sex too seriously is really awkward. Laughing really takes things to a much more relaxed and comfortable level.","And legit having fun while you’re at it - Sex is funny. It’s awkward. It’s let’s-get-naked-and-bump-our-gross-bodies-together. Weird things happen. Weird noises, wet spots, falling off the bed, and don’t even get me started on having a dog in the room with you! The best sex I’ve ever had is whern we can laugh at each other and the situation. Sex doesn’t have to be so serious! Laugh at each other, have fun with each other, and make sure your partner is taken care of","Playing up the unique chemistry you have with this person","If your chemistry is rough and exciting, go with that, and if its more about sweet friendship, stick with that","Throwing that whole orgasm goal out the window ","The first time my ex-boyfriend and I had sex, he assured me that there was no pressure to have an orgasm on his side or my side. I loved how at ease that put me and how easy it was to tell him about what I liked or didn’t like. This whole idea of not 100% focusing on achieving an orgasm allowed us to really focus on pleasure, which completely changes the experience","Being attentive AF - What makes someone good in bed, to me, is when they can read your body. They know what turns you on without you having to say it because they’re that in tune with you and your physical needs","Exuding confidence — even if you don’t totally know what you’re doing - Being confident in your abilities and your abilities to learn can make a huge difference","Taking your time and being thorough - Lip biting, earlobe nibbles, neck kissing, grinding against you at first to build up the anticipation"," Having an epic connection with someone — whether that’s love or lust or friendship or whatever ","Someone who you can get passionate with but afterward have a laugh or two. Being comfortable with the other person and overall trusting them","Making foreplay a thing","Don’t skip it. It makes EVERYTHING feel even better","Getting a little primal you heard about animal sex ..!! ","Someone who loves me but has no interest in ‘making love.’ Sex is primal. Let’s get physical, hit several positions, and fuck like bunnies. After we finish, we have a giggle, eat a pizza, and head for round two","Being SUPER AMPED to be there - A partner who is enthusiastic and 100% into what you’re doing is very hot. What’s sexier than your partner being like, Hell yeah! Let’s do this!","And being up for anything.","Being open-minded to trying new things but also knowing the definitive boundaries for each person Except anything that you or your partner are actually really not cool with. In that case, carry on!","But really, it kinda depends on the person","I know it’s annoying to answer with the bullshit response It depends, but I think this REALLY does. Because some might say a sort of aggressive confidence, sultry, smoldering sexiness, and firm, powerful movements would make you an amazing lover — but I think to some people that would be messy and obnoxious, like you’re being attacked with attempted proof of their sexual prowess. Some people like awkwardness, tenderness, gentle touching; others like it hot and heavy… some people like it super fucked up. And having sex with someone who does the opposite of that would make you think, Wow, they’re bad at sex. But that’s not true for everyone","ON HANDJOBS - At its core, Cosmo is just a girl, standing in front of a boy, trying to figure what to do with his penis. Or, as they put it, trying to figure out how to throw his disco stick a party he'll never forget.","To achieve sex-goddess status, you have to truly master his man bits","Girls attention - Hold his penis in one hand and lightly slap it with the other… you can tap it back and forth like you're volleying a tennis ball and lightly pinch the skin on his shaft and testicles. Many women make the mistake of being too gentle","Think of his shaft… like the outer curve of your breast. …Take his shaft between your open palms and tap it back and forth, almost like you're volleying a tennis ball. The quick movements are a fun way to wake up his nerves","Firmly hold the bottom of his shaft in one hand and slowly push it towards the base. (Imagine you're pushing his penis into his body)","Alternate between swiveling both wrists in opposite directions and stroking your hands upward, twisting your wrists when you reach his head as though you are turning a doorknob. Rub your thumb in a tiny figure-eight pattern over his frenelum… Or try the windshield-wiper move; glide your thumb from side to side along the rim where his head begins, then move your thumb up and over the top of the head several times","34 percent of guys say they wish a girl would surprise them with oral when they walk in the door.","Fifty-six percent of unmarried men prefer receiving head while lying down as opposed to standing up, while the numbers are exactly reversed for married men","Chew a small piece of mango… then take him in your mouth. You can use whatever fruit you have, just don't try anything too acidic, as it can burn him.","Non-acidic fruit won't burn… but it will probably feel just as weird and pulpy as it sounds.","Go hot and cold. During oral, suck in air as you go down and blow it out as you go up.","As you’re going down on him, shake your head from side to side, letting your tongue follow the same pattern on the extra sensitive underside of his penis.","As you move your mouth up and down his shaft, rotate your hand in a corkscrew motion while spiraling your tongue in the opposite direction","We rounded up a bunch of super-sexy tricks just for [your breasts]. If these don't skyrocket your pleasure (and have him drowning in drool), we don't know what will","Tickle his feet with your nipples: climb on top of him in reverse cowgirl position, then bend over until your nipples reach the tops of his feet ..Yowzah","Receive a butterfly kiss… of your breasts. To do: he bats his eyelids against the supersensitive underside of your breasts.","It's time to introduce your breasts to your favorite vibrator… (how rude of your vadge to have hogged it all these years)","Dip your breasts in edible body paint, and use them to 'sponge paint' his entire body. Then lick it off","How big a bucket of edible body paint would you need to dip your breasts in it? And what sort of weirdly dexterous breasts allow for painting? Doesn't this just involve lunging at him like a brightly-colored walrus?","Draw an attention-grabbing circle around your nipples using rhinestones and body glue for a special night in.","Definitely wait for a special night. Nothing’s sadder than body-gluing rhinestones around your nipples on a Tuesday  What is this the Midwest ","Take a few of your favorite erotically appealing flavor combinations like peanut butter and honey or whipped cream and chocolate sauce and mix up yummy treats all over his body","Mix a few flavors of lube to create new combos like strawberry - banana.","The paucity of flavors of personal lubricants is the most pressing crisis facing America right now.Obamaaaaaaaa!","Use silicone based lube to give each other pre  nooky rubdowns ","Mix one tablespoon of saliva (the kind deep in your throat works best its viscosity makes it a good substitute for lube) with one tablespoon of water to stretch the spit ","Dab some peppermint oil on your neck and between your breasts.Studies found that the smell of mint has a revitalizing effect.Bonus  your boobs will smell extra fresh","Keep a spray bottle Feed each other ice cream  in the dark.Not being able to see means more spilling, which means more licking up the mess.","Cook dinner topless apply a little tomato sauce to your nipple and ask your man to lick it off.","Wear a cinnamony lotion or perfume.The smell of cinnamon buns increases men is blood flow down there ","Use your electric toothbrush or your iPhone when your vibrator is out of batteries ","When you have got an annoying roommate Rent a horror movie and play it while you have sex. If they hear any screams they will assume it's the movie.","On film selection - Avoid anything that will cause hearty belly laughs like Superbad  a jiggly tummy wont make you feel good ","When he is least expecting it tell your man you need some change.Then stick your hand in his pocket and touch his penis through the fabric and  pretending that you are really digging around for that coinage you need.When he is good and hard, whisper something in his ear like","Is that a roll of quarters in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?","Slide your hands down the front of his pants and graze his goods when you can tell he is had a hellish day… He really does not want to answer questions like, Are you okay?… but your caress still sends the message that you are picking up his vibe","Slip your hand into his back pocket and lightly stroke his ass… since it’s totally private and hidden from everyone else, it conveys that you’re feeling especially attracted to him","When he is on his way home from work, start giving yourself some solo pleasure and accidentally dial him up. All those breathy ooohs and aaahs will be motivation for him to get to you in time to join in on the action","Record your voice on your cell the next time you have a solo session. Then, send him the audio file in the middle of the day, with just the text, Wanna hear me do this tonight?","As you are eating dinner together, say something X-rated like, See how I am devouring this piece of meat? That is how I am going to devour you","Hide your turned-on vibrator in his sock drawer. When he figures out where the buzzing is coming from, tell him he gets to experience its pleasure power","Give him a beer facial — the combination of the egg white and the yeast in the hops hydrates and improves skin elasticity… but you can just tell him that your lips can not resist his delicious, beer-flavored face.","If your guy is suddenly going around all happy and whistling, then you need to find out why","Be especially careful if he is neat, well-groomed or spending more time at the gym","If his wardrobe is constantly changing, watch out!","Not ecofriendly? It could be a sign that he will  trash your relationship too.","Keep your eye on a guy who loves to social network — he may need constant attention","Reach over and grab his knee while you are both sitting","Grasp his hands and coax them into a prayer position, then position hands over his… Your words will become more persuasive to him, though he won't know why.","Keep a spray bottle filled with ice water next to the bed and give each other a strategic spritz to extend the encounter Aim for the nerve packed thin skinned areas on each others body such as the nipples "]
